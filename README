When you run this version you will see the Sun, Earth, and Mars
wiggling around randomly.  That's because the code that 
repositions the object based on their velocity
has been stubbed to simply impleent a random walk.  

If you run the tests you'll see that a critical test fails.  If
you get that test to run, you will likely find that the objects
orbit the sun as they should.
