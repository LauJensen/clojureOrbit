There are 500 objects in "orbit" around the sun.  There's just one problem.  They don't orbit.  
They just stream away from the sun at a constant velocity.

This can be fun to watch, especially as the objects collide with each other in the first few 
seconds of the simulation.  However, what we really want is for the objects to attract
each other.  

Notice that there are some tests failing.  If you get these tests to pass, you will be close
to implementing gravity...
